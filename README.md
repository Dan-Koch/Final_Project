# Final_Project
This is my final project for the Triple Ten data science coding bootcamp.

The project involved taking data from a fictional telecommunications company and evaluate the data to find out
what are some contributing factors to customer churn, and then create a machine learning model that could
predict customer churn.

I have included the ipynb file as well as an HTML version if you wish to view the project without having 
Jupyter Notebooks installed.
